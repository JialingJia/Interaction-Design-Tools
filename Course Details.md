## Interaction Design Details

##### INTERACTION DETAILS CLASS-1 Forms of GUI Components and Widgets
User Interactions and Manipulations, Controls, Menus, Toolbars, Dialogs, Errors/Alerts/Confirmation

###### User Interactions and Manipulations:
    Computer-based: mouse, keyboard
    Touchscreen: finger gestures
    Wearable: finger gestures, voice input
    television-based: remote control, voice input
    AR/VR: hand or finger gestures

    Mouse: hovering (pointing), clicking, scrolling, dragging
    Keyboard, meta-keys: Ctrl key, Alt key, Enter key, Esc key, Command key (Apple)
    Touchscreen: tab, drag, swipe, pinch, touch and hold, rotate, shake...

###### Controls
    buttons: priority
    links: priority
    checkbox(butcon/toggle): multiple choices
    radio buttons(butcon): mutually exclusive
    list: drop down list
    active and passive validation

###### Menus
    menus: different styles of menus, top, side, entrance to other pages, how to use them in a proper way?
    toolbars: butcon, refers to immediate access to function, tooltips, state-indicated
    dialogs: when to use them on a web application, float tips

###### Errors/Alerts/Confirmation
    Error messages: how to design them in a proper way, identify each error situations when people using the web, and better constructing the language for them (eliminating error messages) -> positive feedback and instant validation before actions.
    Alert and confirmation: avoid accountability

##### INTERACTION DETAILS CLASS-2 Principles of Interaction Designs
Patterns and Information hierarchy

###### Patterns
    Patterns: tone of voice, typography and color choices, iconography, styles, spacing and layout, specific shapes, interactions, animations, and sounds.
    Resource-Good designer-they have their own pattern language, when creating interfaces we use design patterns to solve common problems.
    Patterns for scenarios:
    When the design language is shared knowledge, you can stop focusing on the patterns themselves and instead focus more on the user. What matters is not only the patterns themselves, but how they are evolved, shared, connected and used.
    Patterns Library-limitation-it will restrict your thoughts into those forms and patterns.
    how to apply your patterns into user journey:
    Coupons- list page-> shopping cart-> Billing page, what message a coupon give our users in different stages. Home page, product list page, product page, shopping cart, billing page.

###### Information architecture
    reading patterns, J.J. Gibson, information design
    ontology: physical traits of objects-what is lodge renting; what are the basic traits for lodge renting, what kinds of tourism the lodge renting could provide for; Compared with hotels, what do people expect from Airbnb, such as facilities, services, locations?

    taxonomy:
    scenarios-If Amsterdam is a website, we can expect that the navigation menus for a group of friends traveling here probably is marijuana - casino - red light district; but if you take your one year old son to travel here, your ideal navigation menus might be: Windmill Village - Miffy Rabbit Museum - Milk Powder Shopping Guide or how to quickly refund
    experience-If it is a skin-care website, for a female student, this website needs to be classified according to efficacy of skin-care products: acne-moisturizing-whitening; for senior skin-care bloggers, it may be classified by ingredients: tea tree essential oil-hyaluronic acid-vitamin C
    In taxonomy, the most important thing is not to think about how you need to classify, but to think about what you want to achieve through classification, how do you want users to understand your product?

    choreography: IKEA

    Scenarios-booking.com Fun things to do, why they use, when they use, and how they use
    Hierarchy-
    Rhythm-condense, flat, amazon, clothes, books, try to use different visual spacing and direct people's attention, billing page in amazon and apple
