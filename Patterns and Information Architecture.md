# Patterns and Information Architecture

## Patterns

##### How it forms:
Tone of voice, typography and color choices, iconography, styles, spacing and layout, specific shapes, interactions, animations, and sounds. Good designer have their own pattern language, when creating interfaces we use design patterns to solve common problems.
When the design language is shared knowledge, you can stop focusing on the patterns themselves and instead focus more on the user. What matters is not only the patterns themselves, but how they are evolved, shared, connected and used.

##### Patterns Library:
limitation-it will restrict your thoughts into those forms and patterns.

##### How to apply your patterns into user journey:
Coupons- list page-> shopping cart-> Billing page, what message a coupon give our users in different stages. Home page, product list page, product page, shopping cart, billing page.

## Information architecture
reading patterns, J.J. Gibson, information design

##### Ontology
Physical traits of objects-what is lodge renting; what are the basic traits for lodge renting, what kinds of tourism the lodge renting could provide for; Compared with hotels, what do people expect from Airbnb, such as facilities, services, locations?

##### Taxonomy
Context-If Amsterdam is a website, we can expect that the navigation menus for a group of friends traveling here probably is marijuana - casino - red light district; but if you take your one year old son to travel here, your ideal navigation menus might be: Windmill Village - Miffy Rabbit Museum - Milk Powder Shopping Guide or how to quickly refund.
Experience-If it is a skin-care website, for a female student, this website needs to be classified according to efficacy of skin-care products: acne-moisturizing-whitening; for senior skin-care bloggers, it may be classified by ingredients: tea tree essential oil-hyaluronic acid-vitamin C. In taxonomy, the most important thing is not to think about how you need to classify, but to think about what you want to achieve through classification, how do you want users to understand your product?

##### Choreography: IKEA
Scenarios-booking.com, Fun things to do, why they use, when they use, and how they use  
Hierarchy-
Rhythm-condense, flat, amazon, clothes, books, try to use different visual spacing and direct people's attention, compare billing page between amazon and apple
