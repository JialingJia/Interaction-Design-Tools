      <p class="main">A 14-year-old boy has been charged with murder after authorities said an egg prank sparked a high-speed car chase through a Texas intersection that killed a mother.

      The underage driver was allegedly pelting cars with eggs from an SUV with two juvenile passengers on Tuesday when Harris County authorities said he provoked another driver just before 2:30 p.m. That driver allegedly then displayed a semiautomatic handgun.

      The confrontation sparked a chase between the two vehicles, leading to the boy’s SUV blowing through an intersection’s red light and T-boning a red Ford F-150 that was driven by 45-year-old Silvia Zavala. She was pronounced dead at the scene, authorities said in a release.</p>
